"""Let S be the set of points {(x,y,z), 0<=x,y,z<=3, x,y,z belong 1}. Three distinct points are randomly choose from S. If the chosen points are (x1,y1,z1) , (x2,y2,z2) and (x3,y3,z3), then the probability that x1<x2<x3 , y1>=y2>=y3 , z1>= z2>=z3 and ( (x1+x2+x3)/3 , (y1+y2+y3)/3 , (z1+z2+z3)/3 ) belong to S is x / C(64,3) .
