# Mathmatics using python!

This got hit into my mind, Would be an interesting journey to solve mathmatics using python, with the help of
numpy library of python :D

We are going to use numpy for solving the mathmatics, numpy is a python library that is used to solve
numerical problems. It is memory efficient and faster and has many mathmatics readymade functions.
