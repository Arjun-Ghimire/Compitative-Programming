# Basic About Python 


# Python is used for 

i) Machine Learning 
ii) Artificial Intellegence 
iii) Data Analysis and Many more, but I will using it for AI, ML , Data Analysis only :)

# How to run python code ?

To run python code, you should follow this command format = python <filename>.py

# Indentation

In python indentation is very important, the python comipler will treat the indentation as a block so that it is very important to take care of the indentation, I just wasted my few min to find out the problme of the code and at the end it was just the Indentation problem LOL~!

Conclusion = Take care of the Indentation, its very important in Python.


# Use of ':'

In python this ':' is very useful, this is used to say that we started the new block of code.
simply it says the start of the block when if the condition is true, or function block has started. It is also used for function defination in the python.

It says, start of body of the loop, if else condition , function call, all of it has this ':' in python. We can say like it is substitue of braces in python for function calls or conditional checks only.


# Data Types

Python has several built-in data types, including:

Integers: whole numbers like 1, 2, 3, etc.
Floating-point numbers: decimal numbers like 1.5, 2.0, etc.
Strings: text enclosed in quotes like "hello" or 'world'
Booleans: True or False values
Lists: ordered collections of values
Dictionaries: unordered collections of key-value pairs
Tuples: ordered, immutable collections of values

# List Example
A list is an ordered collection of values, which can be of any data type. Lists are created by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of values in square brackets. For example:

Here is example of Lists -

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

it is accessed using -
print(fruits[1])


# Dictionaries

A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value. Dictionaries are created by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of key-value pairs in curly braces. For example:

Example of Dictionaries -

person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

It has key and value pair

it is accessed using 

print(person["age"])

# Truple 

A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of values, which can be of any data type. Tuples are created by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of values in parentheses. For example:

coordinates = (3.5, 4.2)

This creates a tuple called coordinates that contains two floating-point numbers. You can access individual elements of the tuple by their index, just like with lists. However, you cannot modify the values of a tuple once it has been created.

print(coordinates[0])

The main difference between a tuple and a list is that a tuple is immutable, while a list is mutable. This means that you cannot change the values of a tuple once it has been created, whereas you can change the values of a list.

coordinates = (3.5, 4.2)
coordinates[0] = 2.5

Here the value of coordinates[0] cannot be modified, it is immutable.
