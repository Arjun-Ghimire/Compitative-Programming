# CodeDecode

I got a playground to play with codes :)
Participating at CodeDecode, this made me learn python, so happy with the initiative.

Also I relaized that, python is such a beautiful and easy to use and a very simple language, I regreted for not learning python till today lol!

I am loving to solve these competative coding problems using PYTHON!
